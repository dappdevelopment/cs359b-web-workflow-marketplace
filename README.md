Many business tasks are repetitive: filling out forms for QA testers, moving data between spreadsheets for salespeople, syncing data between apps for HR, etc. Allowing designers to build and sell workflows helps users automate menial tasks and focus on core competencies.

Our web workflow marketplace serves two groups of users: a) business owners, employees, and consumers who need to automate their work, and b) designers, creators, and authors who can receive payment for their automated workflows.
